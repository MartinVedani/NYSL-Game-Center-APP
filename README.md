In this module, I was an independent developer the Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) hired to create an app to give their players and parents easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules. To avoid the hassles of native apps, the client wanted this to be a mobile web app. I designed and developed the mobile web app, and added features to the app that are specific to mobile devices, such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.

To do this, I worked through a series of tasks designed by experts in programming and mobile web app development to help me create a robust and useful mobile web application, specifically:

i.) Using new features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application.
ii.) Creating a responsive design that works for various screen sizes and rotations.
iii.) Taking advantage of specific capabilities of smartphones such as location-awareness.
